# Look and Say Sequence
*In Go | 01-11-2018*
**Start time**: 16:15
**End time**: 18:15


This is the second dojo with a simple challenge, but with a language that was not known to the participants. Next week the problem will be brought by Danilo (
self-determined)

### Impressions
  - Dojo in new language only with the documentation is difficult because if the documentation is bad like Go's, we can not progress
  - Preference of when only those in the front speak, otherwise I think it becomes a tug of war
  - Suggestion to integrate the discussion time in the dojo so as not to leave these impressions for another day
  - Dojo with a new language only with the documentation did not work, maybe if the language was decided in the previous dojo and we had how to study. Or if you could use google.
  - I did not see any problem in everyone talking
  - New language with complex documentation did not help and resulted in the delay in solving the problem
  - The Go language is very complex.
