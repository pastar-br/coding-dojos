### Resources
  - https://pt.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jogo_da_vida (Rules in pt to avoid misunderstandings)

### Impressions
  - More time for the pilot to code
  - The pilot needs to explain more what they are doing
  - We should try to let everyone speak
  - People are still learning the format of the dojo
