This is the third nojo, and I (Danilo) decided to use Javascript and a framework to make a simple snake clone with the rules bellow.

### Rules
  - The snake should be controlled with the keyboard.
  - The snake should grow when it eats something.
  - The snake should die when it leaves the map.
  - The snake should die if it touches itself.
  - The food should appear in a different location when eaten by the snake.
