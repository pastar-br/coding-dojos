# Game of Life
*In Ruby | 18-10-2018*
**Start time**: 15:25
**End time**: 16:00


Since this was the first dojo, some of the rules were set during the coding and the time wasn't properly defined.
The challenge was not finished and will be continued next week.


### Resources
  - https://pt.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jogo_da_vida (Rules in pt to avoid misunderstandings)

### Impressions
  - The rules weren't set up
  - Too many interruptions by third-parties
  - Time of coding for each participant wasn't properly followed
  - Good to follow up on the current code instead of changing it
